			<h1>SAMOSA</h1>
			<h3>why somosa is best snack</h3>
			<p>Most Indians think of the samosa as a humble street snack but it is much, much more than that. The deep fried, tightly pack of spicy goodness that we thought belonged to India is actually a delicious and well-travelled immigrant from Central Asia!<br>
			There are few snacks that pair as perfectly with tea as samosa, and the chai-samosa combination is the national favourite when it comes to friendly addas, family gatherings, brainstorming sessions and heated political discussions. Each city has a shop that claims to serve the tastiest samosa in town. Some street-corners and crossroads have become famous merely because a samosa seller’s kiosk is located there.its flavor and taste brings water in any mouth The samosa is undoubtedly the brightest star in the constellation of Indian street food. When you bite into a gorgeous, golden samosa, what you taste is the story of India itself – a melting pot of cultures, cuisines and cooking traditions.</p>

			<h4>STEPS IN MAKING SAMOSA</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>PART 1 - Making the Dough</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
								<strong>Sieve the flour and salt together in a bowl.</strong> You can add a little more or less salt to taste if you desire.</p>
								<img src="1a.jpg">
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>Add the ghee or oil.</strong> Mix it in with your fingers, working with a handful of flour at a time. Keep mixing until all of the flour is coated with fat and a dough has begun to form. It should still be quite dry and flaky.</p>
								<img src="2a.jpg">
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>	Mix in 5 tablespoons of water.</strong> Use your finger to work the water into the dough to loosen it up. The consistency should be soft and pliable, but not wet. Add more water if necessary.</p>
								<img src="3a.jpg">
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>								Turn out the dough and knead it.</strong>
 Put the dough on a clean surface and knead it with your hands for about 4 minutes, until it is smooth and slightly shiny. Form it into the shape of a ball.</p>
								<img src="4a.jpg">
							</li>
							<li>
								<p><strong>
								Allow the dough to rest for 30 </strong>minutes. Cover it with plastic wrap. Let it rest on the counter while you make the filling.[3] This will help the dough achieve a better texture.</p>

							</li>
						</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>PART 2 - Making the Filling</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p><strong>
								Heat the ghee in a large saucepan.</strong> Place it over medium high heat and allow the ghee to get hot.</p>
								<img src="1b.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>	<strong>
								Toast the cumin seeds. </strong> Toasting the seeds brings out the best in their flavor and scent. Toast them until the room becomes fragrant and the seeds start to crackle, about 30 seconds.
							</p>
							<img src="2b.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>
							Add the onion and ginger.</strong> Sauté them with the seeds for about five minutes, until the onion becomes translucent.</p>
							<img src="3b.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>
							Add the garlic, chili peppers, turmeric, salt, and garam masala.</strong> Sauté the spices and fold them into the mixture for one minute.</p>
							<img src="4b.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>
								Add the potatoes and peas.</strong> Stir the mixture gently and cook until the potatoes become dry, which should take about 3 minutes. Mix well and mash lightly.</p>
							<img src="5b.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>
								Cool the filling. </strong>Remove it from heat and allow it to cool while you prepare the chapatti for filling.</p>

						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<label>PART 3 - Assembling Samosas</label>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p><strong>
								Divide the dough into eight equal portions.</strong> You can use a measuring cup, but it's easier to just eyeball it.
							</p>
							<img src="1c.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>
								Roll in each round into chapattis.</strong> A chapatti is a thin, flat circular bread or dough. In this case, each one should be about 6 inches (15.2 cm) in diameter. Use a rolling pin or press the chapattis into shape with your fingers.
							</p>
							<img src="2c.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>	<strong>
								Cut each chapatti into two halves. </strong>Use a knife to slice each one in half.
							</p>
							<img src="3c.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>		<strong>						
								Stuff and fold the samosas.</strong> Spoon 2 teaspoons of filling into the center of a piece of dough, then bring the edges together to form a cone shape. Seal the edges carefully using a little water. (You can also make paste using flour and water for easier sealing).
								<ul>
									<li>Use your fingers to press the edges of each samosa into place.</li>
									<li>For a lovelier edge, you can use a fork to press the edges together.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<img src="4c.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>	<strong>			
								Repeat with the remaining chapattis and filling. </strong>	As you finish filling each one, set it aside on a plate or a baking sheet.
							</p>
							<img src="5c.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>	<strong>Heat the oil.</strong> Pour several inches of oil into a large dutch oven or a high-sided frying pan. Heat the oil until it reaches 350 °F (177 °C). Use a candy thermometer to test whether the oil is hot, or place a small piece of dough in the oil to see if it sizzles.
							</p>
							<img src="6c.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><strong>
								Fry the samosas.</strong> Place 3 to 4 samosas in the pot to fry. Deep fry them for about 10 minutes, until both sides are golden brown. Don't try to crowd the pot with too many at once, or they may fall apart instead of cooking properly.
								<ul>
									<li>After each batch is finished frying, use a slotted spoon to move the finished samosas to a plate lined with paper towels to drain off the extra oil.</li>
									<li>Take care not to let them fry for too long, or the dough will become tough.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<strong>
								Serve hot with green chutney.</strong> Hot crispy samosas are ready to eat with chutney.
